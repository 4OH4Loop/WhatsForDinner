(Note: The API is glitchy in Xcode preview and Simulator, often resulting in time out request errors. When installed on an iPhone, the app runs smoothly.)

The What's for Dinner app helps you quickly answer the nightly question your significant other or roommate is bound to ask when it's the furthest thing from your mind. No more going back and forth for so long you could've cooked and eaten dinner by the time you both agree on what to eat. 

Other recipe apps are full of so many rabbit holes that an entire tv episode flies by in the background while you search for the perfect dish to cook for dinner. What's for Dinner cuts to the chase, immediately presenting you with the option to generate a randomized meal from thousands of recipes. 

Don't like what you see, but you're starting to figure out what you're in the mood for? 
What's for Dinner lets you set quick filters like cuisine and prep time to filter your randomized
results. 

Nearly on target, but now you're in need of the recipe for the specific dish you've been 
inspired to cook based on your suggested results? Quickly search for the dish, all from the main menu.

Did you riff of the app's recipe to make the dish a little more interesting? With a few taps on your app, you can save your custom recipe and easily refer back to your bespoke recipe cards in the elegantly simple toolbar on the home page. No more "doom scrolling" necessary to decide What's for Dinner.

This app leverages the Spoonacular API that brings in thousands of recipes for use in apps (see API documentation: https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Search-Recipes-by-Ingredients). The MVVM organization is used to keep track of the lenghty code and files necessary to pull data from the Spoonacular API, render data to users in an organized manner, and facilitate user input in efficient ways that don't feel overwhelming or cumbersome.
